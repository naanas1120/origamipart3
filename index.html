                <ul>
            <li> teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.</li>
            <li> the first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.</li>
            <li> The world's smallest stitched teddy bear is a mere 0.29 inches tall! It was created by South African artist Cheryl Moss who is known for her minuscule work.</li>

                <li> Pandas have carnivorous teeth, but they eat bamboo and fruit.</li>

                        <ul>
                    <li> Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
                    <li> They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
                    <li> Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>
