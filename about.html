           Hello! Welcome to Origami designs
           Our goal is to show more people how to make origami while helping them improve their skills and promoting artists and others in the international paper folding community.

Our blog features amazing work from a variety of very talented artists, we also have a collection of book reviews and recommendations plus much more!
